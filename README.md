## 🧠 Why This Project?

Most beginner portfolios are static.  
This project focuses on **interaction design** and **system thinking**, similar to how real-world dashboards and applications work.

Instead of using libraries or frameworks, everything is built from scratch to deeply understand:
- how the browser works,  
- how UI states are managed,  
- and how user experience is engineered.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Fake routing using History API  
- Animations using GSAP  
- Project data from JSON
